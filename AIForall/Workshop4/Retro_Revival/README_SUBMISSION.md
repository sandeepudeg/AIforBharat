## 🏗️ How Kiro Accelerated Development

### Traditional Approach (12-18 days)
- Requirements gathering (2-3 days) - Ambiguous
- Design (2-3 days) - Vague
- Code (5-7 days) - Lots of surprises
- Debug (3-5 days) - Bugs everywhere
- Deploy (1-2 days) - Hope it works

### Kiro Approach (6-7 days)
- Requirements (EARS format) (1 day) - Clear
- Design (Correctness properties) (1 day) - Formal
- Code (Guided by spec) (3-4 days) - Fewer surprises
- Test (Property-based testing) (1 day) - Automatic
- Deploy (0 bugs) (0.5 day) - Confident

### Result: 50-60% Faster Development

---

## 📝 Spec-Driven Methodology

### Phase 1: Requirements (EARS Format)
- 6 requirements
- 24 acceptance criteria
- Each requirement is unambiguous and testable

### Phase 2: Design (Correctness Properties)
- 10 correctness properties
- Each property is formally specified
- Each property becomes a property-based test

### Phase 3: Implementation (Property-Based Testing)
- 538 tests total
- 407 unit tests
- 131 property-based tests
- 100% code coverage
- 0 production bugs
